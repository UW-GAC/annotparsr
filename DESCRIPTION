Title: A R package for Parsing Annotation File for Database Import
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Ben", "Heavner", email = "bheavner@uw.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package reads the annotation source data line by line, parses the lines,
  and imports to a database. Since the lines are independant, this will hopefully be done in
  parallel.
Depends: R (>= 3.3.2)
