# annotparsr

This package reads the annotation source data line by line, parses the lines, and imports to a database. Since the lines are independant, this will hopefully be done in parallel.

## Installation

You can install annotparsr from github with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("annotparsr/UW-GAC")
```

## Example

This'll come, once I have some!

```R
...
```
